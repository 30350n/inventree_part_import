# InvenTree Part Import

This project offers a command line interface to easily import parts from suppliers like
DigiKey, LCSC, Mouser, etc. into your InvenTree instance.

## Installation

```console
pipx install inventree-part-import
```

*(`pip` should also work, but [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is the new recommended way
to install standalone applications)*

### Arch Linux

Latest version from PyPI is available on AUR as
[python-inventree-part-import](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-inventree-part-import).<br>
Git master version is available as
[python-inventree-part-import-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-inventree-part-import-git).<br>
(Thanks to [@randrej](https://github.com/randrej)!)

## Getting Started

### Initial Configuration

When using the CLI tool for the first time, it will guide you through creating your own
configuration.

When configuring suppliers, it's **highly recommended** to always enable the DigiKey API:

```console
select the suppliers you want to setup: (SPACEBAR to toggle, ENTER to confirm)
> [x] DigiKey
  [ ] LCSC
  [ ] Mouser
  [ ] Reichelt
  [ ] TME
```

#### Default categories/parameters configuration

```console
setup default categories/parameters configuration:
> Copy categories from InvenTree
  Copy default categories configuration
  Create empty configuration (manual setup)
```

If you have already been using InvenTree for some time (so you already have setup your category
structure, parts, etc.), select the `Copy categories from InvenTree` option, to automatically
setup a configuration which matches your InvenTree database.

If you are a new user, you can select the `Copy default categories configuration` to create
a basic configuration which you can extend in the future.

You can also create your own configuration from scratch (or manually copy
[someones existing configuration](https://github.com/30350n/inventree_part_import_config)
) by selecting the `Create empty configuration (manual setup)` option.

### Basic Usage

To import parts, simply use the `inventree-part-import` command, followed by the supplier or
manufacturer part numbers of the parts you want to import.

```console
$ inventree-part-import <part_number_1> <part_number_2> ...
```

You can also batch import multiple parts from tabular data files (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, etc.) like
so:

```console
$ inventree-part-import parts.csv
```

## Configuration

### `inventree.yaml`

This file is used to configure authentication to your InvenTree host.
It has two parameters:

- `host`: the host url to connect to (including port, if required)
- `token`: the user token to authenticate with (this will be retrieved automatically by the CLI)

### `config.yaml`

This file is used to configure general settings of the CLI tool, as well as default locales.
The following parameters have to be set:

- `currency`: the default currency to use when searching suppliers (ISO4217 code)
- `language`: the default language to use when searching suppliers (ISO639 code)
- `location`: the default location to use when searching suppliers (ISO3166 code)
- `scrape`: whether or not web page scraping is allowed (this can get you temporarily blocked)
- `interactive_part_matches`: the maximum number of parts to display in interactive mode
  (set to null to disable)
- `interactive_category_matches`: the maximum number of categories to display in interactive mode
- `interactive_parameter_matches`: the maximum number of parameters to display in interactive mode
- `ipn_format`: Optional default template for defining IPN part numbers.  See [IPN Templates](ipn_formats).
- `part_selection_format`: standard python format str used to format each line of the
  interactive part selection menu (any fields from the `ApiPart` dataclass can be used,
  defaults to: `"{MPN} | {manufacturer} | {SKU} | {supplier_link}"`)
- `auto_detect_columns`: list of column names in tabular data files that will be automatically
  detected (defaults to `["Manufacturer Part Number", "MPN", "part_id"]`)

### `suppliers.yaml`

This file is used to configure supplier specific behavior.
The following parameters are always available:

- `currency`: overrides the currency for searching this supplier (see [`config.yaml`](#configyaml))
- `language`: overrides the language for searching this supplier (see [`config.yaml`](#configyaml))
- `location`: overrides the location for searching this supplier (see [`config.yaml`](#configyaml))

Additionally suppliers can have extra parameters for authentifcation to their respective APIs.
These can be set via the CLI like so: `inventree-part-import --configure <supplier>`.

#### DigiKey

For getting a DigiKey API key, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/peeter123/digikey-api#register).
Be sure to use a [Production App](https://developer.digikey.com/documentation/organization),
**not the Sandbox API!**

#### Mouser

Request a **Search API** key from the [Mouser API Hub](https://www.mouser.com/api-hub/).

#### TME

Request an API key at the [Developers Page](https://developers.tme.eu/).

### `categories.yaml`

This file should specify all your InvenTree categories, as well as metadata like category
aliases, parameters, etc. for them.

It's defined as hierarchical tree structure where every 'node' represents a category.
For example:

```yaml
Electronics:
    Capacitors:
        Ceramic:
        Electrolytic:
Products:
```

Additionally you can define the following meta attributes (starting with `_`):

- `_aliases` has to be a list of supplier category names which will be mapped to that category
- `_description` specifies the categories description (defaults to category name)
- `_ignore` makes `inventree-part-import` ignore that category, as well as any subcategories
- `_ipn_format` specifies a template to use for defining IPN part numbers (see [IPN Templates](#ipn-templates))
- `_parameters` has to be a list of parameter names (for parameters defined in
  [`parameters.yaml`](#parametersyaml)) this category uses<br>
  **note: parameters get inherited by sub categories**
- `_structural` can be set to `true` to make the category structural

Here's an example for a config with special attributes:

```yaml
Electronics:
    _description: Electronic Components # custom description
    _structural: true # no parts are allowed to be directly in this category
    Capacitors:
        _parameters: # parameters for both the 'Ceramic' and 'Electrolytic' categories
            - Capacitance
            - Tolerance
        Ceramic:
        Electrolytic:
            _aliases: # category names mapped to this category from various suppliers
                - Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors
                - Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors - SMD
                - Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors - Leaded
                - Electrolyte Capacitors
Products:
    _ignore: true # this category contains our own products, so we won't import anything into it
```

### `parameters.yaml`

This file should specify all your InvenTree parameters, as well as metadata for them.

The following meta attributes are available:

- `_aliases` has to be a list of supplier parameter names which will be mapped to that parameter
- `_description` specifies the parameters description (defaults to parameter name)
- `_unit` specifies the parameters unit (experimental)

Here's an example for a single parameter:

```yaml
Input Voltage:
    _aliases:
        - Voltage - Input
        - Voltage - Input (Max)
        - Maximum Input Voltage
    _description: Max Input Voltage # optional
    _unit: V # experimental, this can lead to import problems
```

### IPN Templates

You can optionally use IPN templates to define a custom IPN name on parts.  If you do not configure
any templates, the IPN value is not used.  When templates are defined, which are standard Jinja2
templates, the template result along with the CLI option `--ipn never|new|always`, are used to
define the IPN value.  You can have a single default template for all imports, or customize the
template per category in the hierarchy.

Templates have several context variables available:

- `category`: the category name of the part
- `manufacturer`: the name of the part manufacturer
- `parameters`: a dictionary of all parameters
- `part_id`: a unique number (the primary ID of the part), useful to create unique numbers
- `MPN`: the manufacturer part number
- `SKU`: the suppliers part SKU
- `supplier`: the name of the supplier

Some examples:

- `PN-{{ part_id }}`: A unique ID such as `PN-382`
- `{{ supplier }}-{{ SKU }}`: A combination of supplier name and SKU, such as `LCSC-C38221`
- `{{ parameters.Resistance }}-{{parameters.Wattage }}-{{parameters["Package Type"] }}`: A name
  built from parameters, such as `18.2K-0.25W-0603`.

  > Some vendors have more consistent parameters than others, so consider using the `--dry` CLI
  > option on several parts which will show the template results without updating the database.

  > A missing value for a context variable, such as a parameter that doesn't exist, will result in an empty value.
  > Template values are filtered to remove all leading, trailing, and duplicate common
  > separator values (`-`, `_`, and spaces), to avoid names like `RES---322` when parameter values are
  > not matched.

The first supplier that finds a matching part will be used to define the context variables for the
template (for example, the parameters from the first successful supplier search).  Use the `-s <supplier>` option to always search a specific supplier first.

You optionally specify category-specific templates in
`(categories.yaml)[categoriesyaml]` using `_ipn_format`.  For example, `Resistor` might have
`RES-{{ parameters.Resistance }}` whereas `Capacitor` might use `CAP-{{ parameters.Capacitance }}`.
Templates are searched in hierarchical order, starting with the closest category and working up the
tree to the top level.   If no category template is found, the default template
in `(config.yaml)[configyaml]` under `ipn_format` is used.  If no template is found, the IPN number will not be
added.  Use the `--ipn never|new|always` CLI option for runtime control, where `new`
is the default behavior (only add an IPN if the part does not already have one)

### Pre Creation Hooks (`hooks.py`)

Pre creation hooks are functions that get run after part information has been parsed from a
supplier, but before the InvenTree part gets created. They basically let you modify a part,
before it gets imported. This can be very useful in some cases.

For example, here's one that assigns transistors into different categories, based on their type:

```py
def fix_transistor_categories(api_part):
    if "BJT" in api_part.category_path[-1] or "Bipolar (BJT)" in api_part.category_path:
        transistor_type = api_part.parameters.get("Transistor Type", "")
        if "NPN" in transistor_type:
            api_part.category_path.append("NPN")
        elif "PNP" in transistor_type:
            api_part.category_path.append("PNP")
```

You can define any number of them in a `hooks.py` file in your configuration directory.
They'll get called in the order they're defined in.

## Goal

The end goal of this project is to not exist anymore in it's current form. Ideally everything
the CLI tool does would be directly available from the InvenTree web interface. This will most
likely be done by implementing plugins which offer the required functionality for each supplier.
